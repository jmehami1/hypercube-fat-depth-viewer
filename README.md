# hypercube-fat-depth-viewer

1. Run `testing_reflectance_viewer.m` to see example of expected reflectance line plot with STD area from threshold-ed upper and lower fat depth values



2. Open the `reflectance_fatdepth_viewer.mlapp` which gives a basic layout for interactive viewer app to show reflectance line plot with shaded STD.

I've written some code in the `ReflectanceScalarViewer.m` class
